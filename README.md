# Vue personal page

After discovering that my previous Angular.js personal page was actually boring (no one visiting my webpage cares about my education/work experience) I decided to build a new one. Before I was only using Angular as an external library for the data bindings. This time I had to do it the right way: webpack, client routing, components, etc. First step: replace Angular with Vue!
