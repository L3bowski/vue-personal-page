                First things first!
                <b>Stadia is not free forever</b>. You can try it free of charge for a month, but you will then be billed 9.99â‚¬ on a monthly basis. I'm usually not a fan of this free trial like strategies (I rather prefer to get a limited version of the service for free and then having the chance to unlock additional features by upgrading),
                <b>but I must recognize that Stadia gaming experience is worth trialing</b> even if you are resolved not to buy.

            <p>
                And
                <i>"why is it worth trailing?"</i> I can hear you asking to yourself. Leaving aside the great videogame experience itself, the most interesting aspect from my point of view is the fact that you can play from your computer without installing any software. It might seem an irrelevant detail, but let's keep in mind that a very similar idea turned

                >Netflix</a> from an online pay-per-rent DVD rental company to one of the biggest streaming provider in the world.
                <b>Stadia could be the end of consoles obsolescence</b> (e.g. Play Station 1, Play Station 2, Play Station 3... and the list goes on).

                Another promising feature, which I haven't tested out personally, is that
                <b>it can be played in multiple devices such as smartphones, tablets and TVs</b>. I tried playing from my low range smartphone but, even though the game managed to start, the Xiamoi Redmi 5 is not powerful enough to keep the pace. You can check whether your device is supported in Stadia's website. Also notice that for an optimal game experience they recommend using the

                On the other hand,
                <b>Stadia has a few downsides</b>. First and more important:
                <b>the games still need to purchased one by one</b>. You will get some for free when you sign up so you can test the platform, but if you want to play any game out of that selection you will need to pay for it separately. I didn't care much about which game to play so I tested out the four of them, beeing

                We could argue whether there are enough available videogames or not but I trust the list will grow as the time goes by, as well as the number of players in the community. Another issue I do must point out are the
                <b>recurrent disconnections</b> I've been suffering

                >HP Pavilion 13 x360</a>. I was using a 92Mpbs wired internet connection in both cases, so bandwidth was clearly not the problem here. This issue is particulary annoying because the game keeps running in Stadia servers in the meanwhile, so you can be sure you will have died by the time you reconnect.

            <p>Maybe Stadia won't reach Netflix success, but it can definitely shift the videogames industry direction for good. No matter you are a tech enthusiast, an unconditional videogame player or just a curious person, taking advantage of this free month won't hurt you and it will give you a clue of what the future of the videogames might look like. In any case, if you are not willing to pay for their services you can easily cancel the subscription when the time arrives:</p>
